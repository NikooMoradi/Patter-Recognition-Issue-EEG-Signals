In this project, we aimed to investigate the impact of feature extraction and selection on the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural net- works. We utilized time and frequency domain features, normalized and initially selected through Fisher score, and further optimized by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algo- rithm. Training both networks with these selected features under 5-fold cross-validation, we compared the outcomes to highlight the PSO algorithmâ€™s efficiency in refining feature selection. This approach demonstrated the importance of targeted feature selection in improving neu- ral network accuracy, offering a valuable strategy for future AI applications in complex data analysis scenarios.
